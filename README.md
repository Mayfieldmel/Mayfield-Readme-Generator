## The Generator

The Mayfield Readme Generator generates a standard readme template interpolated with user input data.

## Tools

* The generator was built and developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 
* Node.js was used to collect user data and generate a readme.md output.
* Inquirer was used to prompt users with questions in the terminal.
* Markdown was used to create a readme template for user data to be interpolated into.
* Github hosts the repository and published the website.

## Installation

Clone the github repo to your computer. Then, install npm by typing ***npm i*** in the terminal and pressing enter. Once npm is installed, instal inquirer by typing ***npm i inquirer@8.2.4*** and pressing enter.
